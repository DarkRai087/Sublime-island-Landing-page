      "Ross Island, also known as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, was once the administrative headquarters of the British during their colonial rule in India. The island was named after Sir James Ross, who discovered the island in 1841. In the late 19th century, the British established a penal settlement on the island and used it as a base for military operations in the region. The island was also used as a recreation spot for British officials and had various amenities such as a golf course, tennis court, and a church. After India's independence, the island was handed over to the Indian Navy and was used as a military base. However, a major earthquake in 1941 damaged most of the structures on the island, and today, it remains a popular tourist spot and is maintained by the Indian Tourism Department.",
      "Overall, Ross Island offers a unique blend of history, nature, and adventure, making it a must-visit destination for tourists visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.",
